If design is in flux and it's difficult for designers to understand, is that good for non-designers?

### 3) Awesome Humans: Yes We Can

How do we move the conversation away from dystopia, and not to eutopia, but to being present in the now most constructively?

### 4) Three Tasty Trend Mixes

What do we sense is happening out there and how is it making us feel good (or bad) and more curious for the future?

When we consider how computation will enable everything and all things with us and without us, what's left?

### Design is now maturing ‚Äî expect some awkwardness.

* There are three kinds of design. Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design.
* In the last 12 months there were 19 acquisitions of creative agencies and companies.
* The value of design is in relation to the other parts of a company's operations. 
* Alone and isolated within a company, design is a microworld of aesthetic high-fives. 
* Scaling design at the speed of Moore's Law is not possible. Scaling design IS possible at a slower-than-desirable velocity.
* Inclusive design has achieved broad acceptance among designers. For non-designers, inclusive design can be a harder idea to sell.
* There‚Äôs fear about AI's future impact, but there‚Äôs creative hope out there too. _Yes we can._

### Design confuses both designers and non-designers.

* The value of design is in relation to the other parts of a company‚Äôs operations. 
* Alone and isolated within a company, design is a microworld of aesthetic high-fives. 
* The complexity of design interests designers, but the rest of your org doesn‚Äôt care.

* China is leading in designing experiences at a scale and level of sophistication that astounds. 
* Most designers believe that visual designers will start to be replaced by AI in five years.
* There are three kinds of design. Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design. 
* A computational designer understands computation at the level of code and networks.
* A computational designer thinks critically about technology and its impact on people.
* A computational designer leverages AI as one of the their tools to co-construct new ideas.

>Explanations of automated decisions need not hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function. Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box. Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support.

[Counterfactuals](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ai-bias-black-box-sandra-wachter) describe a dependency on the external facts that lead to that decision without the need to convey the internal state or logic of an algorithm. As a result, counterfactuals serve as a minimal solution that bypasses the current technical limitations of interpretability, while striking a balance between transparency and the rights and freedoms of others (e.g. privacy, trade secrets).‚Äù

**Recognize exclusion.** 

>Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases. Seek out exclusions as opportunities to create new ideas and inclusive designs.‚Äù

**Learn from human diversity.**

To help people feel more comfortable with the applications, the applications should build on skills that people already have, not force them to learn new ones.
