Sontag On Images
]

"A capitalist society requires a culture based on images. It needs to furnish vast amounts of entertainment in order to stimulate buying and anesthetize the injuries of class, race, and sex. And it needs to gather unlimited amounts of information, the better to exploit natural resources, increase productivity, keep order, make war, give jobs to bureaucrats. The camera's twin capacities, to subjectivise reality and to objectify it, ideally serve these needs as strengthen them. Cameras define reality in the two ways essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a spectacle (for masses) and as an object of surveillance (for rulers)."

What is Reality?

"The photographic falsifier holds up not a mirror to the world but a looking glass through which the observing subject is slyly invited to step, like Alice, into a place where things are different  where facts seem indistinguishable from falsehoods and fictions and where imminent paraadox continually threatens to undermine established certainties."

# Design is about learning, testing, and iterating with customers

.quote[
"The best results come from constantly blending user research—quantitative (such as conjoint analysis) and qualitative (such as ethnographic interviews). This information should be combined with reports from the market-analytics group on the actions of competitors, patent scans to monitor emerging technologies, business concerns flagged by the finance team, and the like. Without these tensions and interactions, development functions may end up in a vacuum, producing otherwise excellent work that never sees the light of day or delights customers." —[McKinsey Study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design)

Key takeaways for 2019 are:

* "Figma, which was low on the list in 2017, emerges as the most exciting tool of 2019."
* "InVision Studio remains near the top, indicating that many respondents have yet to try it—or are still waiting for future development."
* "Respondents always seem to keep Framer on their bucket list of design tools.

* Ecommerce is still only a small fraction of retail spending, and many other areas that will be transformed by software and the internet in the next decade or two have barely been touched. Global retail is perhaps $25 trillion dollars, after all.

Microsoft’s pioneering work in inclusive design as led by Kat Holmes started to be picked up by non-designers and business leaders. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence’s implications to design became evident with new advancements in machine learning that were both exciting and frightening.]

We saw the emergence of new tools and creative communities as producing increased value, and inclusive design had just started to arrive in the zeitgeist of the product landscape. Adopting an inclusive design approach expands a tech product’s total addressable market. The tipping point for inclusive design begins to tip.]

We moved from “tech-led” to “experience-led” digital products as services on smartphones took over and gave access to everyone. Designing for mobile brought new experience constraints compared with the desktop, and made designers’ skills invaluable as the pathway to non-techy consumers.]

"Explanations of automated decisions need not hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function. Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box. Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support.

[Counterfactuals](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ai-bias-black-box-sandra-wachter) describe a dependency on the external facts that lead to that decision without the need to convey the internal state or logic of an algorithm. As a result, counterfactuals serve as a minimal solution that bypasses the current technical limitations of interpretability, while striking a balance between transparency and the rights and freedoms of others (e.g. privacy, trade secrets)."

### This isn't going to be an easy topic to end on

Kat Holmes' [Mismatch](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mismatch) framework is a useful starting point for a beginner like me, and maybe you too:

1. **Recognize exclusion.** Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases. Seek out exclusions as opportunities to create new ideas and inclusive designs.
2. **Learn from human diversity.** Human beings are the real experts in adapting to diversity. Inclusive design puts people at the center from the very start of the process, and those fresh, diverse perspectives are the key to true insight.
3. **Solve for one, extend to many.** Everyone has abilities, and limits to those abilities. Designing for people with disabilities actually results in designs that benefit people, universally. Constraints are a beautiful thing.

.x-small.quote["When members of a team are cut from the same cloth, the average value of their innovations will be relatively high, while the variation around that average is low: That is, you don’t see many failures, but you don’t see many extraordinary breakthroughs either. 

As the team members’ fields become less and less similar, however, the average value of the team’s innovations falls while the variation in value around that average increases: You see more failures, but you also see occasional breakthroughs of unusually high value." —[Lee Fleming, HBS (2004)](https://hbr.org/2004/09/perfecting-cross-pollination)]
