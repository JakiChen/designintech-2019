"Clay vessels are remarkably durable, yet they are vulnerable to breakage if mishandled or dropped. This distinctive technique was based on the longstanding practice of using plant resin lacquer as an adhesive, but Japanese craftsmen transformed the appearance of the repair by sprinkling the lacquer with powdered gold, thus creating a new component for appreciation. 'Gold' lacquer repairs became closely associated with ceramic utensils used for tea (chanoyu)." ‚Äî[Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Golden-Seams-The-Japanese-Art-of-Mending-Ceramics-4567) (2008)

"Facebook acquired Onavo in 2013 for a reported $200 million to use its VPN app to gather data about what people were doing on their phones." 

"But Facebook quietly repurposed Onavo code for use in its Facebook Research app that TechCrunch found was paying users in the U.S. and India ages 13 to 35 up to $20 in gift cards per month to give it VPN and root network access to spy on all their mobile data."
