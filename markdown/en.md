# ðŸ˜Ž **Cool** Robots (starting in 1942)

.quote[
> "1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence so long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws." â€”[Isaac Asimov](https://theconversation.com/after-75-years-isaac-asimovs-three-laws-of-robotics-need-updating-74501)
