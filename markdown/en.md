A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence so long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws." —[Isaac Asimov](https://theconversation.com/after-75-years-isaac-asimovs-three-laws-of-robotics-need-updating-74501)

1. Delight in the process
2. Use only the best ingredients

6. Have an opinion
7. Delay gratification
8. Choose your customers
9. Make better, not more
10. Grow in a sustainable way

Soon, we will also open-source the whole product, WordPress-style. Anyone will be able to deploy their own version of Gumroad, make the changes they want, and sell the content they want, without us being the middle-man."

# Going Retro / How To Re-Spark Joy ...

"Clay vessels are remarkably durable, yet they are vulnerable to breakage if mishandled or dropped. This distinctive technique was based on the longstanding practice of using plant resin lacquer as an adhesive, but Japanese craftsmen transformed the appearance of the repair by sprinkling the lacquer with powdered gold, thus creating a new component for appreciation. 'Gold' lacquer repairs became closely associated with ceramic utensils used for tea (chanoyu)." —[Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Golden-Seams-The-Japanese-Art-of-Mending-Ceramics-4567) (2008)
